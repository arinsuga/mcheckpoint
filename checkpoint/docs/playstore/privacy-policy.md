# Privacy Policy for mCheckpoint

Effective Date: 2026-01-21
Developer: Arin Suga

## 1. Introduction
mCheckpoint (“the App”) is a Mobile Checkpoint Application designed to help users manage and track checkpoints efficiently. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user data, particularly in relation to sensitive permissions such as the camera.

## 2. Permissions Used
- **Camera (android.permission.CAMERA)**
  The App uses the device’s camera solely for scanning QR codes, capturing checkpoint images, or other core functionality directly related to its purpose.
  - The App does not record video or take photos without explicit user action.
  - The App does not store or transmit camera data outside the user’s device unless required for checkpoint functionality.

## 3. Data Collection and Usage
- **No Personal Data Storage**: The App does not collect, store, or share personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Checkpoint Data**: Any data captured (e.g., QR codes, images) is used only to facilitate checkpoint operations.
- **Local Processing**: Most data is processed locally on the device. If data is transmitted (e.g., to a server), it is strictly for checkpoint validation and operational purposes.

## 4. Data Sharing
- The App does not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.
- Data may be shared only with authorized systems or servers necessary for checkpoint functionality, and never for advertising or marketing.

## 5. Security
We implement reasonable technical measures to protect any data processed by the App. However, users are responsible for maintaining the security of their devices.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
mCheckpoint is not directed toward children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version hosted at the provided URL.
